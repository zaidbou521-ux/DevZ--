const DESCRIPTION = `
Exit planning mode after the user has accepted the implementation plan.

IMPORTANT: Only use this tool when:
1. A plan has been presented using the write_plan tool
2. The user has EXPLICITLY accepted the plan (said "yes", "accept", "looks good", etc.)
3. You are ready to begin implementation

This will:
- Switch to Agent mode for implementation
- Change the preview panel back to app preview
- Begin the implementation phase

Do NOT use this tool if:
- The user has requested changes to the plan
- The user has asked questions about the plan
- No plan has been presented yet

Example usage after user says "Looks good, let's build it!":
{
  "confirmation": true
}
`;
